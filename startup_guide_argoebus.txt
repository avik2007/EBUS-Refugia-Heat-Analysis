conda activate oceanography

code . (for VSCode)


Notebook Order
1. PullArgoData_test.ipynb - first test of loading Argo data
2. SparsityAudit.ipynb - investigate the sparsity of Argo Data in space 
3. TestDataLoadAndValidationMethods.ipynb - testing GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) functions developed in ArgoGPR.py

Scripts
1. ArgoHeatContentDataCollater.py - used for loading data and doing all the thermodynamic calculations needed to convert raw 
Argo Data for temperature, salt, density, and pressure into heat content. Theoretically, could be extended to other quantities
2. ArgoGPR.py - Implements Gaussian Process Regression for the Argo Data
